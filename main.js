/*

You have volunteered your time to a local political candidate,
Elizabeth Sanger, who wants to become a US representative in
Congress for your district. Unfortunately, the team discovered
that you're a software developer, so they have begged you to build
an application that lets them track volunteers, and store information
about Elizabeth and her campaign.

Your job is to define the different objects and arrays, their
structure, and the corresponding properties for each, to represent
the following information about Elizabeth's campaign.
